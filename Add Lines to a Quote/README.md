# Plugin Sample - GRN Duty Rename
This plugin changes the "Duty" text in the cartage grid to "Import Levy".  In the handler code, we start by obtaining the form via the "sender" of the event - this allows us to reach the grid of interest.  Then, we iterate through the grid looking for the "Duty" row.  Finally, having found the row we want to modify, we use GridText to set the text of the cell at column "RowHeading", row "dutyRowNo".
